    "My father buttons my coat while one of our sharecroppers brushes my hair."

    "I have to squeeze my hands past both of them to sign."

    t2 "You're not even going to look at my speech?"

    dad "You're a man of the Thatchers now, Alex. If I didn't trust you to be responsible, I'd have asked you to stand in the back and smile."

    dad "Now, that said, San Francisco and Vancouver are sending ambassadors, so I'm really trusting you to be responsible."

    t2 "If I get nervous and need to throw up, which ambassador do I throw up on?"

    dad "Well, the Mayor of Vancouver did try to sell us a defective shipment of rifles last year."

    dad "I'm a forgiving guy, but vomiting on his ambassador seems like a proportional response."

    "He steps back and lets another of our sharecroppers start on my tie."

    dad "If the people of this town get to know you one tenth as well as I do, they are going to love you."

    "He kisses me on the back of the head and leaves to finish getting ready."

    s2 "You look like a penguin."

    "I laugh and flip him the bird."

    "I've met Phineas Barrow (the seventh, I think?) at social functions before. We bow to each other and he signs what a phenomenal honor it is to see me again. Seems a bit excessive."

    "I only ever see Jared Crenshaw at events like this. He bows deeply, but seems a bit chilly. Might just be nerves."

    "Theodore Sedgewood takes center stage and launches into a speech about our town's history."

    "He stands at the podium signing, and ten of his sharecroppers positioned on platforma around the audience repeat his signs so that everyone can see the speech."

    "He always makes a couple jokes about current events, but other than that it's the same speech every year."

    ts "This Fathers' Day we honor the Five Fathers, who lead our town through famine and strife and forged a strong, loving community."

    ts "My great-great-grandfather, Ichabod Sedgewood, a farmer who loved his workers like his own children."

    else:
        ts "But after too much blood was spilled, their sons came together and forged a lasting peace."

    ts "Cornelius Thatcher, a builder, strong of body and strong in his convictions. When Thatcher signed, everyone watched to see what he said."

    "I clap a little harder and whoop a little louder for my great-great-great-grandfather."

    if openness >= 2:
        ts "Temperance Goodwin, a teacher of great wit and wisdom, and the woman responsible for mediating the peace between Sedgewood and Crenshaw."

            t2 "He's just jealous that Temperance gets two whole founding families to herself."

    ts "And, of course, Phineas Barrow, the railwayman who had faith in this land and led our forefathers here. Could everyone named Phineas Barrow please stand up?"

    "Around ten Phineas Barrows stand and grin at each other. The crowd waggles their hands in laughter."

    "My attention drifts as Theodore Sedgewood's speech trickles out into repetition and platitude."

    ts "But this year, we have three fine young men and women ready to join our town as Men of the Houses!"

    "I leap to my feet. Kathleen Goodwin and Dave Sedgewood and I hold hands and raise them in the air."

    "Our parents agreed beforehand that it was important to emphasize unity between the founding families."

            "But it's the back of the crowd that I'm looking at, where the sharecroppers stand."
            "The sharecroppers look around and sign to each other, unsure if they're allowed to applaud."
            "Of course they all want land reform, but it's the sort of thing nobody talks about in public except a couple eccentric Goodwins."

            dad "Maybe they'll love you so much that they'll kill me so you can take over the Thatcher family."
            dad "I don't know which frightens me more-- thinking that you were too foolish to realise that, or thinking that you absolutely knew."
