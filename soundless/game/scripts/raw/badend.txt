BAD ENDING Openness < 3

The Fathers' Day parade was good this year. Everyone still remembers that disaster from ten years back when they tried to work instruments into the parade.

People didn't ask for sound to come back, and they weren't ready for it. Even before the Fix, most of us went around with earplugs.

I just don't know how to read sound-- it was like someone flashing bright colored lights into my eyes all the time.

But it was more than just an inconvenience. It would have been the death of our town.

We live in an agrarian throwback in an industrial world. There's no shame in admitting that.

We could survive like that as long as every town spoke their own homegrown sign language, but once sound came back, so did spoken English.

At first, people just used spoken English to communicate with outsiders.

But some people wanted it to replace the signs. They wanted to tear down our traditions, change our way of life.

The sharecroppers demanded the right to abandon the land in the peace agreement. Once they spoke English, they started to abuse that right, migrating to Vancouver and San Francisco in droves.

Even once we had restored their legal responsibility to the land, the sharecroppers used sound as a weapon against us.

They would whisper to each other in the fields, plotting further acts of violence. If our overseers couldn't see what they were saying, they couldn't keep our town safe.

After what happened to the Sedgewoods, that was an unacceptable risk.

The Fix is safe, painless, and fair. Founding families and sharecroppers alike get Fixed.

While our neighbors are wracked with change, we are stable and content.

And now that we are Fixed, sound will never trouble us again.
