    "CORNELIUS THATCHER, 1885"
    
    gt "Are... we having for... tonight, papa?"

    t "Hm?"

    "Grace's signing is still so clumsy. You'd think that they would learn faster, the young ones."

    t "What was that?"

    gt "What are we having for supper tonight, papa?"

    t "Ah, that..."
    t "We'll talk about it later, alright, sweetheart? Papa's tired for now."

    "It's Sunday, and we've spent all morning and afternoon playing with the other children in the square. You'd be amazed, how these children are always just bursting with energy."
    "It was a different case for me. I wasn't so young anymore."
    "Perched together on the porch of the schoolhouse, Grace and I've just shared a picnic."

    t "I'm going to rest for a bit, okay? You should head back to the house, see if any of your brothers want to play."

    gt "Okay, papa!"

    "She gives me peck on the cheek before heading off."
    "I watch as her small frame skips, noiselessly, down the trail."
    "Finally, I have some time alone."
    "I'd thought making the journey to Oregon Territory, raising my homestead, building this town, that was the most difficult thing I'd ever done."
    "That was before I had children."

    "I stretch out on the porch and suck in a breath of the Oregon air."
    "Closing my eyes, I begin to nod off to sleep."
    "You know, with your eyes closed, the silence becomes much more noticeable."
    "It's been close to 20 years now that , and we still haven't gotten used to it."
    "I doubt we ever will."
    "In the blackness, the silence is deafening."
    "It's indescribable, really, how dreadful the silence is."
    "And yet, sometimes- and only sometimes-"
    "there's a certain peacefulness to it."
    "To sound being gone."
    "I'm sure the others feel it too, not that they'd ever admit it."
    "You'd notice it while watching the sun rise at dawn."
    "Or while holding your newborn daughter in your arms."
    "Sometimes, the silence adds something. It makes events seem so much more... personal."
    "Like, there isn't anything coming between you and everything else. No distance, no difference. You're part of the same system, the same soundless world."
    "You become connected to everything else, and all seems well for just a little while."
    "The mere fact that there is such a thing left as peace in this muted world..."
    "Sometimes, it gives me the strength to go on."
    "..."
    "..."
    "..."
    "I'm thrust awake by someone tapping me on the shoulder."

    t "...Mmf!"

    "I brush them away, but to no avail. They hit me harder."

    t "Hey!"

    "After all these years without sound, still yelling in pain. Something about being human; you never learn."
    "I rub at my eyes before turning to face Temperance Goodwinson. Obviously annoyed, she makes emotive gestures with her hands."

    g "Hey, you! The Crenshaws are back from the hunt, we should get down there."

    "It takes a second for it to get through me. I'm still groggy."

    t "... Oh, is that so?"

    g "Come on, get up. And what kind o’ place to sleep is the schoolhouse’s porch!?"

    t "I was tired, alright. I’m not the dashing young man I used to be."

    "Temperance gives a huff as she heads off on her way to the crowd that's formed in the center of the square. I pick myself up and follow behind."
    "Fidgeting my way past the crowd, I can see the Crenshaws staying their horses and Phineas Salisbury inspecting them. He's gesturing to them in an orderly manner, his lips pursed closed."
    "Some of Phineas's men are unloading things from the horses, wrapped up and covered in canvas. They seem to be the spoils of the hunt... And they're looking scarce."
    "Though it's not like we'd been expecting anything else. What with sound being gone, wildlife worldwide's been thrown to hell. The prey can't hear their predators stalking them anymore, and the predators are running out of prey."
    "And thanks to the food shortages, the rioting in the cities has gotten worse. It's nearly to the point of anarchy, and bands of outlaws and criminal factions have sprouted up from the chaos like a plague."
    "It's a horrid world, the one we live in."
    "Thanks to sound being gone, there aren't many good things left in it."

    s "You didn't encounter any parties from the other settlements?"

    c "No, not this time."

    s "It's been a while since we have. Doesn't sit well with me."

    c "I don't mind it so much, the hunting's gotten easier. We'll head out again this weekend and see if we can't do better."

    s "No, I can't say that's a good idea. Something's not right. On top of our leftovers and reserves, this should be enough to last a week. You can go then."

    c "'This is enough,' you say? Unless we all want to be gnawing on hide and bones for supper, it's not even close. Especially with all the young ones."

    s "We'll manage. If you go too soon your tracks will still be fresh, and odds are you'll be expected. You could walk right into a trap."

    c "Lay off. We make our own decisions."

    s "I'm just showing concern for you, is all. Raiding parties are a bigger threat now than ever, what with the game dying out. People are growing desparate. There's even been those rumors about cannibals..."

    c "Get off our backs. We're not doing this for you, we're doing it for this town."

    s "I'm acting in the best interests of this town. Don't question my stance on these raiders, Crenshaw."

    c "Yes, well, you didn't lose a son to them. So I think I'll handle them how I see fit."

    s "But if you'd just listened to me back then, you would never have lo-"

    c "I would never have what, Salisbury?"

    s "..."

    c "We'll be taking our leave now."

    "Terrence yanks his horse over and begins to shove his way past the crowd."
    "He spits on the ground as the other Crenshaws follow, leaving the spoils of the hunt for Salisbury to dole out as always."
    "Phineas sighs and rubs his temples before turning to address the townspeople."

    s "Alright, let's see. The rations are going to be... a little harder to deal with this time, everyone, but let's cooperate here."

    "He furls up his nose, rolls up his sleeves, and begins to sort through the spoils."
